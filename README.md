# Q-Live Demo
This project was my first attempt at writing a React application from scratch (as part of an interview). If you launch it, you'll see a homepage pulling headlines from the Quake Reddit and a few links to things like a mock server browser -- Quake 1 of course, the greatest FPS of all time.

Overall, it took about 8 hours or so, aiming to simply play around the React basics:
* React
* React router
* JSX
* Stateful & stateless components
* Basic application component layout

Not covered:
* Redux
* Typescript

If anyone ever sees this, well hopefully it's a simple enough thing for you to learn from as well.

### Oh yeah...
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
